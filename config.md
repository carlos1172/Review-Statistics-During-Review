1. tz (default:8, tz = n where n is your GMT+n value. Mine is GMT+8, hence 8. Use a negative value if yours is negative (e.g. GMT-4))

3. nodays (default: 7, how many days ago anki should look back to compute new, learn, relearn, and review weights)
4. showDebug = 0 (default: 0, shows debug information for development purposes)
